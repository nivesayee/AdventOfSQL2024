Create a query that returns pairs of elves who share the same primary_skill. The pairs should be comprised of the elf with the most (max) and least (min) years of experience in the primary_skill.

When you have multiple elves with the same years_experience, order the elves by elf_id in ascending order.

Your query should return:
The ID of the first elf with the Max years experience
The ID of the first elf with the Min years experience
Their shared skill
Notes:
Each pair should be returned only once.
Elves can not be paired with themselves, a primary_skill will always have more than 1 elf.
Order by primary_skill, there should only be one row per primary_skill.
In case of duplicates order first by elf_1_id, then elf_2_id.
