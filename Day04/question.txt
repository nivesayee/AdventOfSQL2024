Help the elves analyze toy tags by finding:

New tags that weren't in previous_tags (call this added_tags)
Tags that appear in both previous and new tags (call this unchanged_tags)
Tags that were removed (call this removed_tags)
For each toy, return toy_name and these three categories as arrays.

Find the toy with the most added tags, there is only 1, and submit the following:

toy_id
added_tags length
unchanged_tags length
removed_tags length
Remember to handle cases where the array is empty, their output should be 0.
