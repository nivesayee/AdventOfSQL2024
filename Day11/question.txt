Mrs. Claus needs a comprehensive analysis of the tree farms. Using window functions, create a query that will shed some light on the field perfomance.

Write a single SQL query using window functions that will reveal these vital patterns. Your analysis will help ensure that every child who wishes for a Christmas tree will have one for years to come.

Order them by three_season_moving_avg descending to make it easier to find the largest figure.

Seasons are ordered as follows:

Spring THEN 1
