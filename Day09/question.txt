Rudolph is retiring as lead reindeer, and Santa needs to analyze each reindeer's speed records to choose the new leader.

To do this you need to:

Calculate the average speed for each reindeer in each exercise type, excluding Rudolf.
Find the highest average speed for each reindeer amongst those average speeds.
Select the top 3 reindeer based on their highest average speed. Round the score to 2 decimal places.
Enter the name and score of the top 3 reindeer in the format name,highest_average_score, but remember Rudolph is retiring so don't pick him.
