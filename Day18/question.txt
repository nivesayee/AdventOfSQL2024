Write a query that finds the number of peers for the employee with the most peers. Peers are defined as employees who share both the same manager and the same level in the hierarchy.

Find the employee with the most peers and lowest level (e.g. smaller number). If there's more than 1 order by staff_id ascending.

Note: When counting peers, include the employee themselves in the count. So two employees who are peers would give a count of 2.

Submit the id of the staff member
