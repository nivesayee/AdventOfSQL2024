Parse out all the query parameters from the urls.

A query param is a list of key value pairs that follow this syntax ?item=toy&id=1

Note the & is how to list multiple key value pairs.

Once you extract all the query params filter them so only the urls with utm_source=advent-of-sql are returned.

Submit the url with the most query params (including the utm-source)

If there are multiple rows order by the url ascending
